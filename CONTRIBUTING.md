   cd bypass-city-extension
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Create a branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Lint code
npm run lint
```

### Making Changes

1. Make your changes in the appropriate files
2. Write or update tests for your changes
3. Ensure all tests pass: `npm test`
4. Ensure linting passes: `npm run lint`
5. Test the extension manually in Chrome

### Code Style

- Follow existing code style
- Use ESLint (configured in `.eslintrc.js`)
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Add JSDoc comments for functions

## Adding New Domains

To add support for new ad/shortener domains:

1. **Edit domain lists** in these files:
   - `utils/defaultSettings.js`
   - `service-worker.js` (DEFAULT_SETTINGS)
   - `popup/popup.js` (KNOWN_AD_DOMAINS)

2. **Add the domain** to the `KNOWN_AD_DOMAINS` array:
   ```javascript
   const KNOWN_AD_DOMAINS = [
     // ... existing domains
     "newsite.com"
   ];
   ```

3. **Test domain matching**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

4. **Update the count** - The popup will automatically update, but verify the count is correct

5. **Test manually**:
   - Load extension in Chrome
   - Navigate to the new domain
   - Verify auto-redirect works
